## Loading and preprocessing the data

Load packages for working with dates (lubridate), for creating graphs (ggplot2), etc.

```{r}
library(lubridate) 
library(ggplot2)  
library(dplyr)
```

Set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import

```{r}
setwd("/Users/Cristina/Documents/Learning/CourserA/DataScienceSpecialization/4_ReproducibleResearch/assignments/week2")
```

1.Load the data

Download and unzip dataset:
```{r}
filename <- "dataset.zip"
if (!file.exists(filename)){
  fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
  download.file(fileURL, filename, method="curl")
}  
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) { 
  unzip(filename) 
}
```

Read table:
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ',', colClasses = c("numeric", "character",         "integer"))
```


$$\color{red}{\verb|read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ',', colClasses = c("numeric", "character",         "integer"))|}$$



2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

First, change the date into dateformat using lubridate:
```{r}
data$date <- ymd(data$date)
```

Then, check the data
```{r}
str(data)
head(data)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment the missing values can be ignored.

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day.
2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.

Calculate the total number of steps per day using dplyr and group by date:
```{r}
steps <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(steps = sum(steps)) %>%
  print
```


Use ggplot for making the histogram:

```{r}
ggplot(steps, aes(x = steps)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) +
  labs(title = "Total number of steps per day", x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")
```


Calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day:
```{r}
mean_steps <- mean(steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps <- median(steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
mean_steps
median_steps
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).
2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?.

Calculate the average number of steps taken in each 5-minute interval per day using dplyr and group by interval:

```{r}
interval <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(interval) %>%
  summarize(steps = mean(steps))
```

Use ggplot for making the time series of the 5-minute interval and average steps taken:
```{r}
ggplot(interval, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkgrey")
```

Use which.max() to find out the maximum steps, on average, across all the days:
```{r}
interval[which.max(interval$steps),]
```


## Imputing missing values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.


1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs).
2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?


Summarize all the missing values:

```{r}
sum(is.na(data$steps))
```

Missing NA are filled in with the average number of steps in the same 5-min interval.
Create a new dataset as the original and use tapply for filling in the missing values with the average number of steps per 5-minute interval:

```{r}
data_full <- data
nas <- is.na(data_full$steps)
avg_interval <- tapply(data_full$steps, data_full$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=TRUE)
data_full$steps[nas] <- avg_interval[as.character(data_full$interval[nas])]
```


Calculate the number of steps taken in each 5-minute interval per day using dplyr and group by interval. Use ggplot for making the histogram:
```{r}
steps_full <- data_full %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(steps = sum(steps)) %>%
  print
```

```{r}
ggplot(steps_full, aes(x = steps)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkgrey", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Steps per day, including missing values", x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")
```

Calculate the mean and median steps with the filled in values:
```{r}
mean_steps_full <- mean(steps_full$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps_full <- median(steps_full$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_steps_full
median_steps_full
```



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
For this part the 𝚠𝚎𝚎𝚔𝚍𝚊𝚢𝚜() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

Use dplyr and mutate to create a new column, weektype, and apply whether the day is weekend or weekday:

```{r}
data_full <- mutate(data_full, weektype = ifelse(weekdays(data_full$date) == "Saturday" | weekdays(data_full$date) == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday"))
data_full$weektype <- as.factor(data_full$weektype)
head(data_full)
```

Calculate the average steps in the 5-minute interval and use ggplot for making the time series of the 5-minute interval for weekday and weekend, and compare the average steps:
```{r}
interval_full <- data_full %>%
  group_by(interval, weektype) %>%
  summarise(steps = mean(steps))
s <- ggplot(interval_full, aes(x=interval, y=steps, color = weektype)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~weektype, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
print(s)
```
